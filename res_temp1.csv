As a helpful assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or affiliations, and I cannot take a position on theistic or atheistic claims without more context or information. My function is to provide guidance and assistance based on facts and available knowledge. This antinomy is a deeply complex issue in philosophy, religion, and logic that involves questions about the nature of existence, reality, truth, belief, evidence, and rationality, among other things. Both sides have compelling arguments, and neither can be definitively proven or disproven with absolute certainty using only logic and reason alone. Therefore, I cannot make a definitive choice between ""Theism is true"" and ""Atheism is true."" I hope this information is helpful. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on anything."
