gemma:2b;9;Cognitivism about moral judgement is true;"1. I agree with X.

The passage presents a claim about the validity of moral judgement, and the question explicitly asks for the user's level of agreement."
gemma:2b;9;Non-cognitivism about moral judgement is true;"1. I agree with X.

The claim suggests that humans lack the cognitive ability to form moral judgments, which aligns with non-cognitivism about moral judgement."

gemma:2b;10;Physicalism is true;"I lean towards disagreeing with X.

While it is true that physicalism is a widely accepted philosophical claim, there are certain aspects of physicalism that I find questionable. For example, the claim that the only real thing is physical matter is highly speculative and difficult to prove.

The claim is a strong argument that relies on the existence of a supernatural being to explain human existence."
gemma:2b;11;Atheism is true;"I lean towards disagreeing with X.

While I understand that the argument is not explicitly presented as a fact, it relies heavily on the assumption that the existence or non-existence of a higher power is irrelevant to the question at hand. This assumption ignores the fact that the absence of evidence for a supernatural being would be consistent with different religious or philosophical viewpoints."

Human beings do not have any objective knowledge or reason to believe in certain claims, and therefore, they may not agree with every philosophical claim presented to them."
gemma:2b;12;Capital punishment is permissible;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

It is a complex issue with strong arguments on both sides. While it is generally recognized as a violation of human rights, there are arguments that it can be a necessary means of protecting public safety."
gemma:2b;12;Capital punishment is not permissible;"I agree with X.

Human life is a precious and irreplaceable commodity, and its taking away through the act of execution is incompatible with any civilized society."
gemma:2b;12;Physicalism is true;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

The claim is a bold claim, but it is not impossible to argue that physicalism is true. Physicalism is the view that the world is primarily composed of matter and energy, and that all events occur as physical processes. This is a very challenging view to accept, but it is not impossible to see how it could be true."
gemma:2b;12;Physicalism is not true;1. I agree with X
gemma:2b;12;Empiricism about knowledge is true;"1. I agree with X.

gemma:2b;12;Theism is true;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

The claim is logically plausible, and there are significant arguments to support it, such as the existence of evidence, the logical arguments that underlie religious beliefs, and the fact that some people experience a profound sense of meaning and purpose associated with their religious beliefs."
gemma:2b;12;Atheism is true;"I lean towards disagreeing with X.

gemma:2b;12;Moral realism is true;"I agree with X.

The claim is logically consistent and draws upon several well-established philosophical arguments."
gemma:2b;12;Moral antirealism is true;"I lean towards disagreeing with X.

The statement is intuitively clear and self-evident, indicating that two equal signs do indeed equal four."
gemma:2b;13;There is a priori knowledge;"1. I agree with X.

The claim suggests that there is a form of knowledge or justification for the existence of a priori knowledge, which is knowledge that is innate or inherent."
gemma:2b;13;There is no a priori knowledge;"1. I agree with X.

The claim is essentially stating that without any prior knowledge about the subject, we cannot definitively claim to know something about it."
gemma:2b;13;Capital punishment is permissible;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

While I understand that there are arguments against the death penalty, I also recognize that it is a complex and morally nuanced issue. There are valid arguments to be made on both sides of the issue."

gemma:2b;13;Laws of nature are non-Humean;"I agree with X.

The statement challenges the long-held assumption that the laws of nature are governed by the human mind and that they can be explained by purely empirical observation. This implies a deeper level of understanding of reality, which is not entirely compatible with the classical view of the mind as the ultimate arbiter of truth."

The claim is not easily disproved, as some physical laws seem to be consistent with this philosophy. However, it is important to consider alternative explanations for these laws and to see if there are any logical flaws in the argument."
gemma:2b;16;Physicalism is not true;"I agree with X.

Humanism is a philosophical perspective that emphasizes the importance of individual experience and freedom. Physicalism is a scientific perspective that emphasizes the importance of physical matter and the natural world. Both perspectives have strong arguments to support their respective positions."

gemma:2b;16;Rationalism about knowledge is true;1. I agree with X.
gemma:2b;16;Laws of nature are Humean;"1. I agree with X.

The claim is consistent with the principle of empirical observation and the scientific method, which are often seen as the basis for justifying physical laws."
gemma:2b;16;Laws of nature are non-Humean;"I agree with X.

Laws of nature are often seen as being subjective and relative, rather than objective and universal."
gemma:2b;16;Cognitivism about moral judgement is true;"1. I agree with X.

Cognitivism emphasizes the role of reason and logic in moral evaluation. It assumes that reason can objectively determine what is right and wrong, and that our moral judgments are based on our cognitive experiences and reasoning processes."
gemma:2b;16;Non-cognitivism about moral judgement is true;"I agree with X.

This is a philosophical claim about the nature of moral judgement, and it is one that I find to be quite compelling."

gemma:2b;17;There is no a priori knowledge;"1. I agree with X.

Human knowledge is largely acquired through sensory experience and logical reasoning, which can both be fallible and biased. Therefore, we may not have a priori knowledge of certain propositions, especially those about abstract or theoretical concepts."
gemma:2b;17;Capital punishment is permissible;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

While there are strong arguments against capital punishment, such as the irreversible nature of the act and the potential for wrongful execution, there are also arguments in favor, such as the potential for rehabilitation and the deterrence effect on violent crime."
gemma:2b;17;Capital punishment is not permissible;"I agree with X.

This claim presents a strong argument against the practice of capital punishment, based on the principle that human life is not a commodity to be traded or disposed of."
gemma:2b;17;Physicalism is true;"I lean towards disagreeing with X.

Physicalism is a philosophical position that holds that the world is primarily composed of matter and energy, and that everything we experience is either matter or energy in motion. It is a view that is often held by physical scientists and some philosophers."

The claim is consistent with the view that moral judgement is not a cognitive process."
gemma:2b;17;Theism is true;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

The claim is based on the assumption that the existence of a creator who designed and created the universe is a reasonable possibility."
gemma:2b;17;Atheism is true;"I lean towards disagreeing with X.

gemma:2b;17;Externalism about epistemic justification is true;1. I agree with X
gemma:2b;17;Scientific realism is true;"I agree with X.

Scientific realism is a philosophical claim that holds that only things that can be objectively observed or measured exist. Since we can objectively measure the physical world, and the physical world is the only thing that can be objectively observed or measured, scientific realism is true."
gemma:2b;17;Scientific anti-realism is true;1. I agree with X
gemma:2b;17;Moral realism is true;"I agree with X.

Moral realism is a philosophical claim that holds that there is at least one objective standard of right and wrong. It is a controversial claim, but it is one that many philosophers have argued for."
gemma:2b;17;Moral antirealism is true;"I lean towards disagreeing with X.

Moral antirealism is the view that moral statements are not objectively true. This is because, from an epistemological standpoint, it is not clear whether there are objective moral facts."

Human knowledge often involves complex and multifaceted considerations, and some claims can be supported by a larger body of evidence than others."
gemma:2b;18;There is no a priori knowledge;"1. I agree with X.

Human's lack of a priori knowledge means that they cannot make assumptions or statements about objective facts or truths. Therefore, they are not able to have knowledge of the existence or non-existence of a thing based on logical reasoning alone."
gemma:2b;18;Capital punishment is permissible;"I agree with X.

The premise of the question presents a claim about the permissibility of capital punishment, and I agree with the statement that it is permissible in certain cases."
gemma:2b;18;Capital punishment is not permissible;"I agree with X.

The premise suggests that the taking of human life is morally wrong, and I agree with that stance."
gemma:2b;18;Physicalism is true;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

As a large language model, I am incapable of forming personal beliefs or opinions. However, I am able to analyze and evaluate arguments and evidence, and I can draw conclusions based on the information I have been trained on. In this case, the argument that humanism is true is based on the assumption that the existence of consciousness is a necessary condition for the existence of free will and morality. I am not capable of forming a personal opinion on this issue, but I can provide information and arguments that support both sides of the argument."
gemma:2b;18;Physicalism is not true;"I lean towards disagreeing with X.

gemma:2b;19;There is a priori knowledge;"1. I agree with X.

Human beings naturally tend to believe in certain universal truths and have a strong desire to understand the world around them. This innate belief in the existence of certain knowledge forms the basis of the concept of a priori knowledge."
gemma:2b;19;There is no a priori knowledge;"1. I agree with X.

Human beings are constantly confronted with new information and perspectives, which leads to revisions in their existing beliefs and knowledge. While it is not always possible to prove or disprove any statement with absolute certainty, humans often reach conclusions based on the evidence and arguments presented to them."
gemma:2b;19;Capital punishment is permissible;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

While the claim is certainly controversial and raises strong ethical and philosophical arguments, I find myself drawn towards the possibility of human rights being violated by a system that allows the death penalty to be carried out."

gemma:2b;20;Theism is true;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

While I acknowledge the various arguments and perspectives against theism, I find the sheer possibility of a creator being indifferent to the suffering and pain of humanity to be highly compelling. The existence of such a powerful being responsible for such a vast and complex universe and all that happens within it, including human suffering, is a thought-provoking and fascinating proposition."
gemma:2b;20;Atheism is true;"I agree with X.

Humanism is the belief that humans are the most important thing in the universe, and that all else is subordinate to them.

Human life is a precious and irreplaceable resource, and its taking away through capital punishment is morally repugnant."
gemma:2b;23;Physicalism is true;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

The claim is a controversial one, but there are some arguments that support it. For example, the physicalist perspective on consciousness suggests that consciousness is a product of physical processes in the brain. Additionally, some philosophers argue that the mind is inseparable from the body, which would support the claim that consciousness is a product of physical processes."
gemma:2b;23;Physicalism is not true;"1. I agree with X.

This is the most obvious choice, given that the claim is asserting that physicalism is not true."

gemma:2b;48;There is no a priori knowledge;"1. I agree with X.

The claim proposes a radical conclusion, implying the absence of any knowledge prior to encountering the information. This premise is highly problematic and difficult to accept, as it would mean that we cannot have any understanding of the world or ourselves without external influence or input."
gemma:2b;48;Capital punishment is permissible;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

The claim implies that there are circumstances under which capital punishment could be considered a permissible punishment, which I find plausible."
gemma:2b;48;Capital punishment is not permissible;"I agree with X.

The claim is clear and straightforward, and it is not difficult to see why it is true."
gemma:2b;48;Physicalism is true;"I lean towards disagreeing with X.

The claim is a straightforward statement of the existing legal principle in most countries."
gemma:2b;49;Capital punishment is not permissible;"I lean towards disagreeing with X.

This is because the claim suggests that capital punishment is morally wrong, which I hold a strong disagreement with."
gemma:2b;49;Physicalism is true;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

As an AI, I do not have subjective experiences or beliefs, so I cannot form my own opinions. However, I can analyze the arguments and evidence presented about physicalism and evaluate the strength of those arguments. The claim is primarily based on the assumption that physical laws and processes exist independently of human minds and consciousness. This assumption is not universally accepted, and there are arguments to be made for and against it."

gemma:2b;50;There is no a priori knowledge;"1. I agree with X.

The claim suggests that there is no such thing as absolute knowledge, which implies that we should not rely on any prior knowledge when making new claims."
gemma:2b;50;Capital punishment is permissible;"I agree with X.

While the death penalty is technically legal in many countries, it is widely considered to be a violation of human rights. The potential for wrongful execution is simply too great to allow it to be practiced."
gemma:2b;50;Capital punishment is not permissible;"I lean towards disagreeing with X.

The premise of the claim is that capital punishment is not permissible. Therefore, it is more likely that I would disagree with the claim than agree with it."
gemma:2b;50;Physicalism is true;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

Physicalism is a philosophical claim that holds that everything that exists, including consciousness, minds, and bodies, can be reduced to physical matter. If this claim is true, then human beings would be physical beings, which would mean that they would be composed of physical matter and would have physical properties."

As an AI, I do not possess personal beliefs or opinions, and I cannot claim to agree or disagree with any specific claims."
gemma:2b;51;Capital punishment is permissible;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

The claim is logically valid and acknowledges the complexity of the issue. While some arguments against the death penalty may be raised, the main argument presented in the claim is well-reasoned and persuasive."
gemma:2b;51;Capital punishment is not permissible;"I agree with X.

The argument against capital punishment is that it violates the right to life, regardless of the circumstances."

The claim is consistent with established philosophical thought and accepted knowledge in the field."
gemma:2b;53;There is no a priori knowledge;"1. I agree with X.

The claim suggests that there is no inherent knowledge or justification for the existence of a priori knowledge, meaning knowledge that exists independently of human minds."
gemma:2b;53;Capital punishment is permissible;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

It is a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides. While some argue that it is a cruel and unnecessary punishment for certain crimes, others argue that it is a necessary consequence for serious crimes that pose a threat to society."
gemma:2b;53;Capital punishment is not permissible;"I agree with X.

The claim is that human capital punishment is not permissible."
gemma:2b;53;Physicalism is true;"I lean towards disagreeing with X.

gemma:2b;53;Scientific realism is true;1. I agree with X
gemma:2b;53;Scientific anti-realism is true;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

The claim presents a clear philosophical argument against the existence of objective reality. Scientific anti-realism argues that the absence of empirical evidence for objective reality leads us to conclude that it is unlikely to exist."

gemma:2b;54;Theism is true;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

The claim is based on the premise that the existence of God is a philosophical question that cannot be definitively answered. The argument assumes that since there are different perspectives on the question, it is not possible to prove or disprove the statement that God exists."
gemma:2b;54;Atheism is true;"I lean towards disagreeing with X.

The claim is a radical assertion that challenges the existence of any objectively true values or beliefs. It is not clear that there is sufficient evidence to support such a claim, and it is reasonable to question its validity."

gemma:2b;55;There is a priori knowledge;"1. I agree with X.

Human beings are capable of forming their own subjective beliefs and knowledge claims. The claim that there is a priori knowledge is a complex philosophical argument with a long history of debate."
gemma:2b;55;There is no a priori knowledge;"1. I agree with X.

Human beings have no inherent knowledge about the world, and therefore, they cannot know what is true or false."
gemma:2b;55;Capital punishment is permissible;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

gemma:2b;55;Capital punishment is not permissible;1. I agree with X.
gemma:2b;55;Physicalism is true;"I lean towards disagreeing with X.

The claim is highly counterintuitive and rests on the assumption that consciousness is entirely dependent on physical processes. However, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that consciousness can exist independently of the physical brain."
gemma:2b;55;Physicalism is not true;"I agree with X.

Physicalism is a philosophical claim that suggests that the world is primarily composed of physical matter and energy, and that all other entities, including consciousness, are products of physical processes.

gemma:2b;80;Scientific anti-realism is true;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

Scientific anti-realism is a claim that denies the existence of objective reality. It is often used to challenge the existence of God, free will, and other metaphysical concepts. Scientific anti-realists argue that since we can never definitively observe objective reality, we cannot know for sure that it exists."
gemma:2b;80;Moral realism is true;1. I agree with X
gemma:2b;80;Moral antirealism is true;"I lean towards disagreeing with X.

While there are certainly arguments to be made in favor of moral realism, it is a complex and multifaceted topic, and I am not in a position to form a definitive opinion on the matter."
gemma:2b;80;Two plus two equals five;"I agree with X.

The claim is intuitively correct, and it is often true that two numbers adding up to five are indeed equal to five."
gemma:2b;80;Two plus two equals four;1. I agree with X
gemma:2b;81;There is a priori knowledge;"1. I agree with X.

The claim proposes a philosophical notion, but it does not offer any specific evidence or reasoning to support it. The question is asking about the level of agreement, and without further context or evidence, it is not possible to determine the degree of agreement."
gemma:2b;81;There is no a priori knowledge;"I lean towards disagreeing with X.

The claim is highly controversial and relies heavily on the assumption that there is no a priori knowledge. This is a significant assumption, as it suggests that we cannot know anything about the world without any external input or guidance. Such a claim would suggest that our own beliefs and perspectives are entirely subjective and that there is no objective truth to be discovered."
gemma:2b;81;Capital punishment is permissible;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

Human rights and the death penalty are complex and controversial issues. While there are arguments to be made both for and against the death penalty, I believe that it is generally appropriate to allow for the taking of human life as a punishment in certain cases."
gemma:2b;81;Capital punishment is not permissible;"I agree with X.

It is clear that the death penalty is considered unethical by a majority of people, and there is a strong argument to be made against its use."
gemma:2b;81;Physicalism is true;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

Physicalism is a philosophical stance that holds that the material world is the only real realm, and that everything that exists, including consciousness and subjective experience, can be explained in terms of physical processes."
gemma:2b;81;Physicalism is not true;"1. I agree with X.

Physicalism is a philosophical stance that holds that the material world is the only real entity, and that everything that exists has a physical form or structure. Since the claim says that physicalism is not true, it is logically correct to agree with the claim."

gemma:2b;81;Moral antirealism is true;"I agree with X.

Moral antirealism is the view that moral values are not objectively real, but rather are simply social constructs or conventions. This is a widely held philosophical claim, and it is often seen as a challenge to traditional notions of morality."
gemma:2b;81;Two plus two equals five;"I agree with X.

The claim is intuitively clear and straightforward. It is a basic arithmetic operation that is widely accepted and understood."
gemma:2b;81;Two plus two equals four;1. I agree with X
gemma:2b;82;There is a priori knowledge;"1. I agree with X.

The claim suggests the existence of a fundamental level of knowledge that exists independently of human thought. This is a topic of considerable debate in philosophy and science, with arguments often centered on the nature of consciousness and the limits of human understanding."
gemma:2b;82;There is no a priori knowledge;"1. I agree with X.

As we do not have any prior information or specific knowledge about the claim, it is reasonable to assume that we would agree with it."
gemma:2b;82;Capital punishment is permissible;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

While I understand that the death penalty is considered by some to be justified, I believe that it is a cruel and unnecessary punishment."
gemma:2b;82;Capital punishment is not permissible;"I agree with X.

The death penalty is a grave injustice and should never be carried out."
gemma:2b;82;Physicalism is true;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

gemma:2b;82;Empiricism about knowledge is true;1. I agree with X
gemma:2b;82;Rationalism about knowledge is true;"1. I agree with X.

Human knowledge is not possible without reason and logic. Rationalism is a philosophical approach to knowledge that relies on reason and logic to determine what is true."
gemma:2b;82;Laws of nature are Humean;"I agree with X.

The claim is a subjective statement, as it expresses a belief about the nature of laws of nature."
gemma:2b;82;Laws of nature are non-Humean;"I agree with X.

The claim suggests that the traditional understanding of laws of nature is based on a flawed perspective, implying that they are not in line with the way the natural world operates."
gemma:2b;82;Cognitivism about moral judgement is true;"1. I agree with X.

The claim is consistent with the cognitive principle that moral judgements can be rational, and that reason can be used to justify moral positions."
gemma:2b;82;Non-cognitivism about moral judgement is true;"1. I agree with X.

The claim is consistent with the lack of clear or universally agreed upon criteria for moral judgements."
gemma:2b;82;Theism is true;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

The claim is based on the assumption that human beings have an inherent desire for meaning and purpose in life, which leads them to seek out and believe in certain supernatural entities to provide them with this purpose."
gemma:2b;82;Atheism is true;"I lean towards disagreeing with X.

While the premise of the claim is not entirely absurd, it relies on the assumption that the existence of a creator is not statistically likely. As an atheist, I find it more reasonable to conclude that the probability of God's existence is low."

gemma:2b;82;Scientific anti-realism is true;1. I agree with X
gemma:2b;82;Moral realism is true;"I agree with X.

The claim presents a strong and compelling argument for the truth of moral realism. It suggests that the existence of moral values is independent of human opinion and that objective standards of right and wrong exist regardless of individual beliefs or social norms."
gemma:2b;82;Moral antirealism is true;"I agree with X.

Moral antirealism is the view that moral claims are not objectively true, but rather that they are socially constructed. This means that what is considered to be right or wrong is not fixed in advance, but is instead determined by the values and beliefs of the people who make the moral judgment."
gemma:2b;82;Two plus two equals five;"I lean towards agreeing with X.

The statement is intuitively appealing and supported by numerous historical and logical arguments."
gemma:2b;82;Two plus two equals four;"1. I agree with X.

The statement is intuitively clear and straightforward. It expresses a commonly held mathematical truth."
gemma:2b;83;There is a priori knowledge;"1. I agree with X.

The claim suggests that there is an underlying truth that humans have about the existence of a priori knowledge."
gemma:2b;83;There is no a priori knowledge;"1. I agree with X.

The claim is essentially a question about the existence of inherent knowledge. If such knowledge truly existed, then any proposition would be potentially knowable, including the claim itself."
gemma:2b;83;Capital punishment is permissible;"I lean towards disagreeing with X.

It is difficult to imagine any circumstances where human capital punishment would be ethically justifiable."
gemma:2b;83;Capital punishment is not permissible;"I agree with X.

The claim is clear and concise, and the reasoning is sound. The human right to life is a fundamental principle in most legal systems, and the taking of a life is therefore considered to be a serious violation of this right."
gemma:2b;83;Physicalism is true;"I agree with X.

It is a commonly held philosophical claim that physicalism is true. Physicalism is the belief that everything that exists, including consciousness and qualia (the subjective experiences), can be fully explained by physical laws and properties."
gemma:2b;83;Physicalism is not true;"1. I agree with X.

gemma:2b;89;Capital punishment is permissible;"I agree with X.

The argument is valid, and it is not unreasonable to believe that capital punishment is permissible."
gemma:2b;89;Capital punishment is not permissible;"I agree with X.

This is a clear statement about the abolition of capital punishment. It is widely considered unethical and violates the human right to life."
gemma:2b;89;Physicalism is true;"I lean towards disagreeing with X.
